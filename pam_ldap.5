.SH NAME
pam_ldap \- LDAP pluggable authentication module
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B pam_ldap
module is a Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) which provides
for authentication, authorization and password changing against
.I
LDAP
servers. 
.LP
Key benefits of the PADL pam_ldap module support for transport layer
security, SASL authentication, directory server-enforced password policy,
and host- and group- based logon authorization.
.LP
The present version of
.B
pam_ldap
supports AIX 5L, FreeBSD 3.x and above, HP-UX 11i, IRIX 6.x, Linux,
Mac OS X 10.2 and above, and Solaris 2.6 and above. Many vendors provide
their own LDAP authentication providers, often also called pam_ldap.
This manual page applies to the
PADL
.B
pam_ldap
module only. If you are using a vendor provided module, consult the
relevant documentation instead.
.LP
When authenticating or authorizing a user,
.B
pam_ldap
first maps the user's login name to a distinguished name by searching
the directory server. This must be possible using the local system's
identity (specified in ldap.conf). (Note that presently only simple
authentication is supported for authenticating in this initial step.)
.LP
To authenticate a user,
.B
pam_ldap
attempts to bind to the directory server using the distinguished name
of the user retrieved previously. Both simple and SASL authentication
mechanisms are supported; in the former case, one should take care to
use transport security to prevent the user's password being transmitted
in the clear.
.LP
A variety of authorization primitives are supported by
.B
pam_ldap,
discussed in the configuration file section below.
.LP
Finally,
.B
pam_ldap
supports a number of password change protocols used by directory servers
from a variety of different vendors. (Some directory servers support
more than one password change protocol.)
.LP
Whilst
.B
pam_ldap
is generally configured in the system LDAP naming configuration file
(ldap.conf), some options can be configured in the PAM configuration
file, to allow for per-service granularity. These options include
the path to the LDAP naming configuration file to use, so in effect
all options can be configured on a per-service basis. Options are
listed below under PAM Configuration.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.B
pam_ldap
stores its configuration in the
.B
ldap.conf
file. (It should be noted that some LDAP client libraries, such as
OpenLDAP, also use a configuration file of the same name.
.B
pam_ldap
supports many of the same configuration file directives as OpenLDAP,
but it adds several that are specific to the functionality it provides.
Unlike OpenLDAP, pam_ldap configuration file keywords are not case
sensitive. Additionally, it is not guaranteed that
.B
pam_ldap
will continue to match the configuration file semantics of OpenLDAP.
You may wish to use different files.)
.LP
Configuration file directives consist of a keyword followed by a
space and any arguments. The following directives are supported by
both
.B
pam_ldap
and the PADL
.B
nss_ldap
module:
.B
.TP
.B host <name:port ...>
Specifies the name(s) or IP address(es) of the
.I
LDAP
server(s) to connect to. In the case that
.B
nss_ldap
is used for host name resolution, each server should be specified as an
IP address or name that can be resolved without using
.I
LDAP.
Multiple servers may be specified, each separated by a space.
The failover time depends on whether the
.I
LDAP
client library supports configurable network or connect timeouts
(see
.B
bind_timelimit
) below.
.TP
.B base <base>
Specifies the default base distinguished name (DN) to use for searches.
.TP
.B uri <ldap[is]://[name[:port]] ...>
For
.I
LDAP
client libraries that support it, specifies the URI(s) of the LDAP
server(s) to connect to. The URI scheme may be
.B
ldap,
.B
ldapi,
or
.B
ldaps,
specifying LDAP over TCP, SSL and IPC respectively. If applicable,
a port number can be specified; the default port number for the
selected protocol is used if omitted.
.TP
.B
ldap_version <version>
Specifies the version of the
.I
LDAP
protocol to use. Presently
.B
version
must be 2 or 3. The default is to use the maximum version supported
by the client library.
.TP
.B binddn <binddn>
Specifies the distinguished name with which to bind to the directory
server(s). This directive is optional; the default is to bind
anonymously.
.TP
.B bindpw <bindpw>
Specifies the cleartext credentials with which to bind. This directive
is only applicable when used with
.B binddn
above. The default is no credential (anonymous bind). When binding to
the directory using
.I
SASL
or other authentication mechanisms apart from simple binds, this
directive is not used.
.TP
.B rootbinddn <binddn>
This directive has the same syntax and effect as the
.B binddn
directive above, except it applies when the effective user ID is that
of the root user. If not specified, then the identity specified in
.B binddn
is used instead. Because the configuration file may be readable by
many users, the root bind DN credentials are stored in the
.B ldap.secret
file instead. This file is usually in the same directory as the
configuration file.
.TP
.B port <port>
Specifies the port to connect to; this directive is used with the
.B host
directive, and is ignored with the
.B uri
directive.
.TP
.B scope <sub|one|base>
Specifies the search scope (subtree, one level or base object). The
default is subtree scope; base scope is almost never useful for
nameservice lookups.
.TP
.B timelimit <timelimit>
Specifies the time limit (in seconds) to use when performing searches. A value
of zero (0), which is the default, is to wait indefinitely for
searches to be completed.
.B bind_timelimit <timelimit>
Specifies the time limit (in seconds) to use when connecting to the directory
server. This is distinct from the time limit specified in
.B timelimit
and affects the initial server connection only. (Server connections
are otherwise cached.) Only some
.I
LDAP
client libraries have the underlying functionality necessary to
support this directive. The default bind timelimit is 30 seconds.
.TP
.B reconnect_policy <hard_open|hard_init|soft>
Specifies the policy to use for reconnecting to a failed
.I
LDAP
server. The default is
.B hard_open,
which reconnects if opening the connection to the directory server
failed. By contrast,
.B hard_init,
reconnects if initializing the connection failed. Initializing may not
actually contact the directory server, and it is possible that a
malformed configuration file will cause
.B nss_ldap
to reconnect. If
.B soft
is specified, then
.B nss_ldap
will return immediately on server failure. All "hard" reconnect
policies block with exponential backoff before retrying. At present
the backoff parameters are not configurable at runtime.
.TP
.B idle_timelimit <timelimit>
Specifies the time (in seconds) after which
.B
nss_ldap
will close connections to the directory server. This directive is
presently not supported by the
.B
pam_ldap
module.
.TP
.B ssl <on|off|start_tls>
Specifies whether to use SSL/TLS or not (the default is not to). If
.B
start_tls
is specified then StartTLS is used rather than raw LDAP over SSL.
Not all
.I LDAP
client libraries support both SSL and StartTLS, and all related
configuration options.
.TP
.B sslpath <cert7_path>
For the Netscape and Mozilla
.I
LDAP
client libraries only, this specifies the path to the X.509
certificate database.
.TP
.B tls_checkpeer <yes|no>
Specifies whether to require and verify the server certificate
or not, when using SSL/TLS with the OpenLDAP client library.
The default is to use the default behaviour of the client
library; for OpenLDAP 2.0 and earlier it is "no", for OpenLDAP
2.1 and later it is "yes". At least one of
.B tls_cacertdir
and
.B tls_cacertfile
is required if peer verification is enabled.
.TP
.B tls_cacertdir <certificate_dir>
Specifies the directory containing X.509 certificates for peer
authentication.
.TP
.B tls_cacertfile <certificate_file>
Specifies the path to the X.509 certificate for peer authentication.
.TP
.B tls_randfile <entropy_file>
Specifies the path to an entropy source.
.TP
.B tls_ciphers <ciphers>
Specifies the ciphers to use for TLS. See your TLS implementation's
documentation for further information.
.TP
.B tls_cert <certificate_file>
Specifies the path to the file containing the local certificate for
client TLS authentication.
.TP
.B tls_key <key_file>
Specifies the path to the file containing the private key for client
TLS authentication.
.TP
The following configuration directives apply to pam_ldap only:
.TP
.B pam_login_attribute <attribute>
Specifies the attribute to use when constructing the attribute value
assertion for retrieving a directory entry for a user's login name.
The default is "uid", for compatability with RFC 2307.
.TP
.B pam_filter <filter>
Specifies a filter to use when retrieving user information. The user
entry must match the attribute value assertion of
(<pam_login_attribute>=<login_name>) as well as any filter specified
here. There is no default for this directive.
.TP
.B pam_lookup_policy <yes|no>
Specifies whether to search the root DSE for password policy. The 
default is "no".
.TP
.B pam_check_host_attr <yes|no>
Specifies whether the "host" attribute should be checked for logon
authorization ("account" in the PAM stack). The default is not to.
If set to "yes" and a user has no
value for the "host" attribute, then the user will be unable to
login.
.TP
.B pam_check_service_attr <yes|no>
Specifies whether the "authorizedService" attribute should be checked
for logon authorization ("account" in the PAM stack). The default is not
to. If set to "yes" and a user has no valued for the "authorizedService"
attribute, then the user will be unable to login.
.TP
.B pam_groupdn <groupdn>
Specifies the distinguished name of a group to which a user must belong
for logon authorization to succeed.
.B pam_member_attribute <attribute>
Specifies the attribute to use when testing a user's membership of a 
group specified in the
.B pam_groupdn
directive.
.TP
.B pam_min_uid <uid>
If specified, a user must have a POSIX user ID of at least
.B <uid>
in order for logon authorization to succeed.
.TP
.B pam_max_uid <uid>
If specified, a user must have a POSIX user ID of no greater than
.B <uid>
in order for logon authorization to succeed.
.TP
.B pam_template_login_attribute <attribute>
When using template users (not supported by all PAM applications),
specifies the attribute containing the user's actual login name.
The
.B pam_ldap
module will set PAM_USER to the value of this attribute if present in the
user's entry, otherwise it defaults to the user specified in the
.B pam_template_login
directive.
.TP
.B pam_template_login <user>
When using template users (not supported by all PAM applications),
.B
pam_ldap
will set PAM_USER to the value of this directive if the user does not
contain a template login attribute.
.TP
.B pam_password <protocol>
Specifies the password change protocol to use. The following protocols
are supported:
.RS
.TP
.B clear
Change password using an LDAPModify request, replacing the userPassword
value with the new cleartext password.
.TP
.B clear_remove_old
Change password using an LDAPModify request, first removing the userPassword
value containing the old cleartext password, and then adding the userPassword
value with the new cleartext password. This protocol is necessary for use
with Novell NDS and IBM RACF.
.TP
.B crypt
Change password using an LDAPModify request, first generating a one way
hash of the new password using
.BR crypt(3)
and then replacing userPassword value with the new hashed password.
.TP
.B md5
Change password using an LDAPModify request, first generating a one way
hash of the new password using MD5 and then replacing userPassword value
with the new hashed password.
.TP
.B nds
This is an alias for
.B clear_remove_old.
.TP
.B racf
This is an alias for
.B clear_remove_old.
.TP
.B ad
Change password using an LDAPModify request, using the Active Directory
Services Interface (ADSI) password change protocol.
.TP
.B exop
Change password using the RFC 3062 password modify extended operation
(only the new password is sent).
.TP
.B exop_send_old
Change password using the RFC 3062 password modify extended operation
(both the old and new passwords are sent). This should be used with
the PADL XAD identity server.
.RE
.TP
.B pam_password_prohibit_message <message>
Specifies a message to send to users indicating that passwords cannot
be changed. This could be used to redirect users to another means of
changing passwords.
.SH PAM CONFIGURATION
It is possible to configure some aspects of
.B pam_ldap
on a per-service basis, in the PAM configuration file (this is usually
/etc/pam.conf; for PAM implementations based on Linux-PAM, per-service
files in /etc/pam.d are also supported).
.LP
The following directives may be specified as arguments to the
.B pam_ldap
module:
.TP
.B
config=<path>
Specifies that
.B pam_ldap
should use the configuration file in
.B <path>
instead of ldap.conf to retrieve its global configuration. Configuring
multiple instances of
.B pam_ldap
for the same service with different configuration files is not supported,
because the configuration information is cached.
.TP
.B
use_first_pass
Specifies that
.B pam_ldap
should always use the first password provided in the authentication
stack.
.TP
.B
try_first_pass
Specifies that
.B pam_ldap
should first try the first password provided in the authentication
stack, and then prompt the user for their
.I
LDAP
password if authentication fails.
.TP
.B
ignore_unknown_user
Specifies that
.B pam_ldap
should return PAM_IGNORE for users that are not present in
.I LDAP.
This forces the PAM framework to ignore the
.B pam_ldap
module. This option is useful where certain accounts do not reside in
LDAP, but one wishes to make
.B pam_ldap
"required" for all accounts in the directory. In this case one would
make both
.B pam_ldap
and the other module (for example, pam_unix) "required" and enable
the
.B ignore_unknown_user
option. (For this to work, the other module must behave similarly for
users in the directory; in the case of a module such as pam_unix that
uses the system accounts database, using
.BR nss_ldap(5)
should be sufficient to meet this requirement.)
.TP
.B ignore_authinfo_unavail
Specifies that
.B pam_ldap
should return PAM_IGNORE if it cannot contact the
.I LDAP
server. This option forces the PAM framework to ignore the
.B pam_ldap
module in this case.
.TP
.B no_warn
Specifies that warning messages should not be propagated to the PAM
application.
.B use_authtok
Analogous to
.B use_first_pass
for password changing only.

.TP
.B debug
This option is recognized by
.B pam_ldap
but is presently ignored.
