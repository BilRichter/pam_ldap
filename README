This is yet another pam_ldap module. Unlike Sun's, this is freely
available (under the terms of the GNU General Library Public Licence).

The advantages of this particular version are:

	o Support for changing passwords in LDAP

	o Support for the V3 client API and protocol (to minimize
	  rebinds)

	o Support for Netscape's SSL API (not tested, though)

	o Compatibility with the nss_ldap configuration file format

The module builds under both Linux and Solaris although it has only been
tested under Solaris 2.6.

I intend to add support for account management from the directory some
day.
