This is yet another pam_ldap module. 

The advantages of this particular version are:

   o Support for changing passwords in LDAP

   o Support for the V3 client API and protocol (to minimize
     rebinds)

   o Support for Netscape's SSL API (not tested, though)

   o Compatibility with the nss_ldap configuration file format

   o Supports ypldapd LDAP locator for plug-and-play installation

   o Supports Netscape Directory Server password policies

   o Supports access authorization on the "host" attribute of the
     account objectclass


The module builds under both Linux and Solaris although it has only been
tested under Solaris 2.6.
