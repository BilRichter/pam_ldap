This is yet another pam_ldap module. 

The advantages of this particular version are:

   o Support for changing passwords in LDAP

   o Support for the V3 client API and protocol (to minimize
     rebinds)

   o Support for Netscape's SSL API (untested as of yet)

   o Compatibility with the nss_ldap configuration file format

   o Supports ypldapd LDAP locator for plug-and-play installation

   o Supports Netscape Directory Server password policies and
     password expiration controls

   o Supports access authorization on the "host" attribute of the
     account objectclass, and on group membership

The module builds under both Linux 2.x and Solaris 2.6.

Thanks to fellow Aussie Chris Albone who wrote the initial pam_ldap_auth module.
