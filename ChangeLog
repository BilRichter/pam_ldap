	* optionally get scope/filter from 
	  "nss_base_passwd" value

	  keys

87	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* support for "timelimit" and "bind_timelimit" in 
	  ldap.conf
	* use "nss_base_passwd" for search base preferentially
	  to "base"
	* fixed code order bug in setting TLS option;
	  introduced by patch in pam_ldap-86

86	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* patches from Norbert Klasen:
	* activate either Start TLS or LDAPS with

	  libraries on Solaris

84	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* fixed typo in pam_ldap.c

83	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* patch from nalin@redhat.com for StartTLS,
	  enforce V3
	* fixed up indenting
	* patch from David Begley to check for netscape4.1 lib

82	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* s/conffile/config; forgot to patch properly

81	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* use MAXPATHLEN instead of PATH_MAX; pam_ldap-80
	  failed on Solaris

80	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* added support for configurable configuration files;
	  you can now specify an alternate configuration file
	  using the config= parameter in pam.conf. This patch
	  was provided by scremer@dohle.com
	* added Solaris-specific linker flag patch from
	  David Begley

79	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* added support for OpenLDAP start TLS, from
	  Alex Schlessinger <alex@hq.workspot.com>

72	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* added nasty_ssl_hack() constructor; this
	  dlopens ourself so that we always remain
	  loaded, and ssl_initialized is set across
	  invocations of PAM. Probably the path should
	  not be hardcoded but sourced from config.h.

71	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* call ldapssl_client_init() once only (this doesn't
	  have the desired effect because PAM unloads the
	  library after pam_end() is called)

49	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* more patches from Scott Balneaves; now just check
	  for shadow expiry date rather than shadowAccount
	  object class
	* added deref parameter to ldap.conf for parity with
	  OpenLDAP

48	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* added patch from Scott Balneaves <sbalneav@legalaid.mb.ca>
