    * Added support for group membership as in Chris'
      pam_ldap_auth module; see the pam_groupdn and
      pam_group_attribute configuration keys.
    * Changed pam_attribute to pam_login_attribute to
      avoid confusion with pam_group_attribute.
    * Support Netscape password expiration controls
    * Avoid authenticating users with empty passwords,
      even if the directory server does
    * Fill in pam_sm_{open,close}_session for completeness
      (they return PAM_IGNORE)
